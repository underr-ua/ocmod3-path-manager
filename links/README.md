# Seo Tools - Links

## Description
The "Seo Tools - Links" extension is for OpenCart 3.x CMS. It allows to manage product and category links, canonical URLs, pagination and more. [Seo Tools - Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/ocmod-space/ocmod-seo-tools/tree/main/breadcrumbs) and [OCMOD Dir Fix](https://github.com/ocmod-space/ocmod-dir-fix) extensions are required.

## Features
* Generates ALL product links and canonical urls based on the one of the following type:
  - Direct links - example.com/product
  - Shortest category path - example.com/cat1/product
  - Longest category path - example.com/cat1/cat2/cat3/product
  - Last category - example.com/cat3/product
  - Manufacturer - example.com/manufacturer/product
* Generates ALL category links and canonical urls (direct or full path)
* Runs pagination via a static URL rather than a parameter, i.e., example.com/category/page-2 instead of example.com/category?page=2)
* Displays page numbers in the title and description of paginated pages
* Has high compatibility with third party templates and modules due to use Opencart Event System
